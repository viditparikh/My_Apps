      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Response: Okay, I've got a couple of recommendations for you, keeping in mind your need for a reliable family car under $30k:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Toyota Camry (around $28,000):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reasoning:** The Toyota Camry is known for its reliability, excellent safety ratings, and good fuel economy. It comfortably seats 5 and comes standard with features like a backup camera, lane assist, and adaptive cruise control, which are great for family safety and convenience.\n",
      "*   **Key Features:** 5-star safety rating, good MPG (28 city/39 highway), and essential safety features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Hyundai Elantra (around $22,000):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Reasoning:** The Hyundai Elantra is a more budget-friendly option that still offers a lot of value. It's fuel-efficient, comes with a fantastic 10-year warranty, and has features like a touchscreen and rear camera.\n",
      "*   **Key Features:** Excellent warranty, good MPG (33 city/43 highway), and a lower price point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Check Availability:** If either of these options interests you, I can check their current availability and stock count.\n",
      "2.  **Test Drive:** I highly recommend scheduling a test drive to see how the car feels and if it meets your family's needs.\n",
      "3.  **Explore Further:** Let me know if you have specific needs (e.g., more cargo space, specific safety tech), and I can refine the search.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",

      "================================================================================\\n\n",
      "Test 3: What's the most fuel-efficient vehicle you have?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Response: OK. The Tesla Model 3 is a great choice. It's an electric sedan with a range of 310 miles, priced at $42,000. It has a 5-star safety rating and features like Autopilot and access to the Supercharger Network.\n",
